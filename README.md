## lab 1
### task4

Write a code to attack some simple substitution cipher. To reduce the complexity of this one we will use only uppercase letters, so the keyspace is only 26! To get this one right automatically you will probably need to use some sort of genetic algorithm (which worked the best last year), simulated annealing or gradient descent. Seriously, write it right now, you will need it to decipher the next one as well. Bear in mind, there's no spaces.

## lab 2

So, for this lab, we were finding the "true face" of the lines by XORing the converted to Ascii ciphered lines together to get pseudocode and XORing it with what we thought could be the start of that line in plain text (we started with "th" and possible words, starting with it, and some common words like "and", "or", etc.), just as in the example with "salsa20"-ed message, ending with a phone number. The author (as discovered from the lines beginnings, is William Shakespeare).
